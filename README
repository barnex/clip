** PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT, NOT YET USABLE **

CLIP is a Command Line Interface music Player.

CLIP does not use a text-based user interface (TUI) , but offers a true command line interface (CLI) with bash completion.

Usage example:

clip add /home/me/music  # adds music to library

clip play kraftw<TAB>  # TAB-completes to "Kraftwerk", if that's in the library, and starts playing.
